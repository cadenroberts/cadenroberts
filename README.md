# Hi, I'm Caden 👋

Machine Learning Engineer building **agentic AI systems, LLM pipelines, and ML infrastructure**.

I design multi-stage AI workflows that combine:
- Retrieval + LLM reasoning
- Automation pipelines
- GPU-accelerated ML systems
- Real-world integration into business and research workflows
